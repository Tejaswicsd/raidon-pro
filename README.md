# RaidOn 🚐  
*A Student Ride Booking Platform*

## 📌 Overview
In Andhra Pradesh, the government recently introduced a free bus scheme for women. While it’s a great initiative, it has unintentionally created problems for college students — most buses are now overcrowded and often don’t reach college stops on time.  

I noticed many students, especially in my area, were struggling to reach classes on time because of this. That’s when the idea for **RaidOn** was born.

**RaidOn** is a student ride booking platform that allows students to pre-book seats in autos or local shared vehicles, similar to booking a bus seat online. It not only helps students get reliable daily transport but also provides consistent rides for local auto drivers.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Students sign up or log in to the platform.  
2. They select their pickup stop, destination, and available seats.  
3. The system books their ride in advance and updates seat availability.  
4. Local auto/shared vehicle drivers get a list of pre-booked students.

## 💡 Key Learnings
Building **RaidOn** taught me how to:
- Handle real-world issues like seat availability and booking conflicts.
- Design responsive user interfaces.
- Develop a system that connects social problems with practical tech solutions.

This project gave me confidence that even as students, we can solve practical issues in our communities through technology.
